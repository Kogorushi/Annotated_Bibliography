  - Abstract: A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must bein the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold.For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in anotherdomain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases,knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data labelingefforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses oncategorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression and clustering problems. In this survey,we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multi-task learning and sample selection bias, as well as co-variate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learningresearch.
