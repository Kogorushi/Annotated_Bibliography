1. [A Survey on Transfer Learning](https://github.com/Kogorushi/Annotated_Bibliography/edit/master/sources/tkde_transfer_learning.pdf)

  - Abstract: A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must bein the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold.For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in anotherdomain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases,knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data labelingefforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses oncategorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression and clustering problems. In this survey,we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multi-task learning and sample selection bias, as well as co-variate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learningresearch.

# Modeling the dissemination of Fake News

1.  [Incentivizing the Dissemination of Truth Versus Fake News in Social Networks](https://github.com/Kogorushi/Annotated_Bibliography/edit/master/sources/1804.02509.pdf)

  - Abstract: Abstract—The concept  of “truth,” as  a  public  good is the production  of  a  collective  understanding,  which  emerges  from  a complex  network  of  social  interactions.  The  recent impact of social  networks  on  shaping  the  perception  of  truth  in political arena shows how such perception is corroborated and established by    the    online    users,    collectively.    However, investigative journalism for discovering truth is a costly option, given the vast spectrum  of  online  information.  In some cases, both journalist and  online  users choose  not  to investigate  the authenticity  of  the news they  receive, because  they  assume other  actors  of  the network had carried  the  cost of  validation.  Therefore,  the  new phenomenon  of  “fake  news”  has  emerged  within the  context  of social networks.  The  online  social  networks,  similarly  to  System of     Systems,     cause     emergent properties,     which     makes authentication  processes  difficult,  given  availability  of multiple sources. In this study, we show how this conflict can be modeled as   a   volunteer’s   dilemma. We   also   show how   the   public contribution through news  subscription  (shared  rewards)    can impact the dominance of truth over fake news in the network.
